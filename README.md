# Hi, welcome to Frznprograms' 💤 LazyVim configurations!

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) can be found with the link.
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Background
I started using Neovim in July 2025, after I saw a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/fFHlfbKVi30?si=IbS39FgD1LC-cWwA) by Kraftzdog aka. Devaslife (on his YouTube channel). I was shocked at how beautiful an IDE could be, and was immediately inspired to investigate Neovim for a daily-use, as I had been a pure VSCode user up until then (no hate to VSCode at all, I just like to work with Vim in the terminal!). That was when I started learning about Vim. For a few months I basically used plugins I discovered through YouTube, but as I became more familiar with Neovim, I noticed a lot of bloat and unused plugins/keymaps. This eventually led to lots of breakages, inspiring me to start fresh and focus only on what I need day-to-day.

## Neovim Version: **0.11.5**
Please refer to the lock file to see which commit/version I am using for each plugin.
